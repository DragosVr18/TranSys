# TranSys
*IN PROGRESS*
*Requires a running Neo4J Aura database*

Personal project for public transport system management. It supports adding, removing and modifying stations, routes and vehicles. 

It's built using Non-SQL graph-structured Neo4j database. Uses MapsUI API, based on OpenStreetMaps, for an interactive map used to view, add and modify entities such as stations and routes.
